To improve its quality, we have standardised theformat and the data it contains. We find it essential to differentiate between costs related to usage and hardware asset costs. This separation allows for better control and tailored offerings to our customers forthese valuable products. Changes have been implemented in the file distribution process to enhance efficiency and control. Moving forward, Techstep will provide the salary deduction file when there areemployee costs related to \"As a Service\" assets. Customers are requested to download the file and ensure the proper execution of actual salary deductions. The main changes\r\n Download file from the portal – Previously, the salary deduction file was sent by email, but this will not be done anymore. In Lifecycle Portal, the salary deduction file will be\r\navailable to download for admin users.Standardised file format –The file format has been standardised for all customers, which means additional columns for some of you. This will imply some adjustments to the\r\nimport process of the salary deduction file to their dedicated salary system. Two salary deduction files for some customers - Customers with Telenor Fakturakontroll or Mytos Kostnadskontroll will get two salary deduction files: one for usage, and onefor cost related to hardware assets. Implicit, this means that these customers need to maintain user data in both Mytos Userdatabase and Lifecycle Portal user database.

Employee ID: The unique identifier of the employee. This will be empty in the salary deduction file if the information is missing in Lifecycle Portal.Salary type: This is the code which defines what type of deduction it is. It is possible to setup Lifecycle Portal with two different salary types: one for monthly employee cost, and\r\none for buyout.Amount: The amount that should be deducted from the employee’s salary. (Format: 123.50)\r\nDescription: This is a text for informative purposes only. It makes it easier to understand if it is monthly or buyout when reading the csv.First name, Last name, email: Only for informative purposes if Employee ID for some reason is missing. It makes it easier to understand the content of the csv. Important information\r\n1. Salary deduction file will NOT be created if customer has not provided Salary type monthly, Salary Type Buyout and Company ID. Example: If Company ID has been definedthe second month after Go Live date, a file will be created the third month and include all the previous salary deductions as individual rows in the file. 2. Every 1st of the month, the salary deduction file will be created if it is configured correctly by the customer and there are any active salary deduction that month. 3. When the salary deduction file is created, an email notification will be sent to the payroll responsible if the customer has set up Lifecycle Portal correctly. It is only possible toadd one recepient email address for this notification. 4. Buyout in salary deduction file is added as an individual row in the salary deduction file. 5. If buyout is selected due to the asset beeing close to end of lifecycle or has allready expired, the buyout will be placed in the salary file the upcoming month. (Example: Buyoutchosen 3 of april, buyout added to salary deduction file 1 of may)\r\n6. In an offboarding situation, if buyout is selected: The monthly employee cost will be added to salary deduction file until the same month as the last day at work. The buyoutwill be added to the salary deduction file the upcoming month from last day at work. Last day at work needs to be selected in Lifecycle Portal as a part of the offboarding\r\nfeature. 7.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"bf01cbb0-3fb2-46ba-aa14-f80d794d2f11":{"id_":"bf01cbb0-3fb2-46ba-aa14-f80d794d2f11","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"+375gaM8Cz+fEj63wpP+f0gtEMvq7HwDuuGwj98eBdo=","metadata":{},"hash":"Ja+rCPY211oPImbOjoY44sv42EcynWMvXaAXSF1Daz0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0a2ec338-9271-43d2-8009-8744c57d899e","metadata":{},"hash":"RgtUtXxlihw4YGojRjfCjPQvfMwps0/34mSipmAtVeo="}},"hash":"K02dfirisA4GChey4bHJGlZHjOL8jMwqFZvo7jlpFaQ=","text":"7.
